h1. The Game of Assault

The Game of Assault is a coding contest project. This version is being developed solely by me, *kornypoet*.

h2. Overview

The Game of Assault is a much more a coding exercise than an actual _game_. The only real _player_ in the
game is the program itself. A successful _scenario_ is one in which the program is able to provide a solution
while adhering to the game rules.

h2. Object

The object of the game is very straightforward: there is a _battlefield_ which will be represented by a grid
of squares with infinitely many rows and columns. The battlefield is divided into two halves by a horizontal
line known as the _battle line_. The upper half of the battlefield will represent enemy territory, while
the lower half will represent friendly territory. There will be _outposts_ placed in enemy territory and _soldiers_
placed in friendly territory. The object of the game is to place the soldiers in such a way so that they may
_capture_ all of the outposts.

h2. Rules

In any given scenario, the outposts are always placed first. An outpost is played within a square on the
battlefield in only enemy territory. Any number and configuration of outposts may be played. Next, any
needed amount of soldiers may be played on squares only in friendly territory. Once all necessary soldiers
have been placed, the soldiers _advance_ one at a time. In order to advance, a soldier must _jump_ over
another soldier directly adjacent to itself, either vertically or horizontally, not diagonally. Once a soldier
has advanced, the soldier that was jumped over is removed, as if they were killed in battle. A single soldier
may advance as many moves as necessary during a turn, provided there are enough soldiers to jump. Once a
soldier has finished advancing, it is left on the battlefield, either in friendly or enemy territory. All
soldiers that have been jumped over are removed. At the end of an advance, if a soldier is on the same square
as an outpost, then that outpost is captured. In order to complete a scenario successfully, all of the
outposts must be captured at the end of an advance. If a soldier has captured an outpost, but is then jumped
over by another soldier, that soldier is then removed and the outpost is no longer captured. All outposts
must have a soldier on them after all jumped soldiers have been removed.

h2. Development

Currently, this project is still under development and as such, is not complete. This area of the README will
detail current progress of the game as it nears completion. Notes and thoughts about the game development can
be found "here":https://github.com/kornypoet/assault/blob/master/notes/NOTES.textile.
