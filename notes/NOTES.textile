Desires:
* use this project to learn and implement new coding practices

Todo:
* write cucumber features describing game results
* decide on a class layout
* decide on a visual representation of the game board and scenario results

Current thoughts:
* the program should pick a beginning outpost, most likely the one that is the 'farthest' away, and then
establish soldier placement. Subsequent outposts will be chosen, again based upon distance, and one at a
time, the program should place soldiers
* perhaps every completed scenario could be stored in a database that can be referenced later
* maybe certain _patterns_ could be stored in the database that can be referenced later
* the first emphasis should be on scenario completion, rather than on optimization
* the game should be run with rake
* first feature tests should probably only test single outposts, in a variety of 'distances'
